# The Whys and Hows of Tidy Data

## What you'll learn in this Chapter

+ How to identify tidy data
+ How to make messy data tidy using `tidyr`
+ Long vs. Wide data
+ The tidy manifesto

After this chapter, you will be able to handle about 90% of your data visualization, data manipulation, and data cleaning problems. Hopefully you'll have gained enough confidence to start going beyond this Bootcamp and learn some more.


<exercise id="2" title="What is Tidy Data?">

Tidy data is defined as data that has the following properties:

- each row corresponds to an observation
- each variable is a column
- each type of observation is in a different table

<img src = "tidy-1.png">

One thing to keep in mind is when columns are not separate variables. One clue is that the column names could be considered categories of a single variable. This means that the columns themselves could each correspond to a single observation.

Look at the `dem_score` dataset in the console by using either `head()` or `summary()` Would you consider this dataset tidy?

<choice>
<opt text="Yes, we consider each row to be a separate observation">
Not quite - look at the columns - is a row considered a single observation, or many over time?</opt>
<opt text="No, each column is not a separate observation, but actually multiple observations" correct="true">
Good eye! Yes, each row and year/column should be considered as separate observations.
</opt>
</choice>
</exercise>

<exercise id="3" title="tidyr::pivot_longer()">

`pivot_longer()` is a special function in the `tidyr` package that takes columns and combines them into a single column. 
`pivot_longer()` takes the following arguments:

- `cols` - the columns to collapse. Here we want to collapse everything into a single column *except* the `country` variable, hence, `-country` as our argument.

We haven't talked about `tidyselect` verbs, but there are a few that let you select columns based on naming criteria. (For more info about `tidyselect`, you can go here: https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/learning_tidyselect)

- `names_to` - the name of the column where the labels will be consolidated to

- `values_to` - the name of the column where the values in the columns in the wide data will be consolidated to.


```
dem_score %>% 
    pivot_wider(cols = -country,
                names_to = "year",
                values_to = "score")
```

### Instructions

+ Try out the above `pivot_wider` statement. 
+ Use a `mutate` expression to remove the `X` in front of `year`.  
+ Assign the output to `gatheredData`.

<exercise id="4" title="tidyr::pivot_wider()">

`pivot_wider()` does the opposite of `pivot_longer()`. It "unbundles" a column into multiple columns.

This situation can happen because related measurements that consist of an observation are collected separately, or someone has `gather`ed the data a little too enthusiastically.

`pivot_wider()` has the following arguments:

- `names_from` - the column that has the names you want to make wider - these will be made into column names.
- `values_from` - the column that has the values you want to make wider - these will be the actual values that are underneath the column names.


```{r}
spreadData <- gatheredData %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year",
              values_from = "score")
```

### Instructions

+ Let's transform our `gatheredData` into a matrix again, but with each column having a `country`. (Hint: you'll need to use `country` as an argument)
+ Assign the output to `spreadData`.

<exercise id="5" title="dplyr::separate()">

Have you ever had a table which had a column that actually consisted of bunch of other columns together,
separated by something? Something like this?

```{r}
"value1/value2/value3"
```
`separate()` is made to make this one variable into many other variable. Separate takes the following arguments:

```{r}
health_code_separated <- 
    health_code_example %>% 
        separate(col=HealthCodeEncounterCode, 
        into=c("HealthCode", "EncounterCode"), sep="/")
```
Here we specify the variable name with `col`, the names of the new columns with `into`, and the delimiter, or separator in the variable to separate on, with `sep`. Note that `sep` can
be any string.

### Instructions

+ `separate` `HealthCodeEncounterCode` into `HealthCode` and `EncounterCode` for  `health_code_example`, assigning the output to `health_code_separated`. Here is an excerpt of the first few rows of `health_code_separated`.:

```
# A tibble: 5 x 3
  PatientID HealthCodeEncounterCode timeElapsed
  <chr>     <chr>                         <dbl>
1 P1        410/22                           20
2 P2        410/20                           15
3 P3        511/22                           16
4 P4        511/20                           17
5 P5        511/20                           30
```

+ Show those patients that had `HealthCode==410`, assigning them to `patients410`. 
+ Show the `head()` of `patients410`.

<exercise id="6" title="Wide Versus Long Data">

In addition to tidy data, we can have long data versus wide data. We call a dataset as *long data*
because the format of the data has many more rows than columns, and we call data *wide data*, 
because it has more columns than rows. You have seen how to transform a *wide* dataset (`dem_score`) 
into a *long* one with `gather()` and transform it into a different *wide* format with (`spread`).

In general, I tend to work with long data because this format makes it easier to aggregate the data for 
plots when I have a lot of covariates. Let's look at what's possible because the data is in a long format.

Let's practice with another dataset in long format, called `fertilityTidy`. You can look at the 
original data as `fertilityData`. We'll summarize it in two different ways.

### Instructions

+ Look at `fertilityTidy`. Show the average fertility by country to present day by using `dplyr` verbs, calling this variable `meanCountryRate`. Here are the first few rows of `fertilityTidy`:

```
              Country Year fertilityRate
1         Afghanistan 1800          7.00
2             Albania 1800          4.60
3             Algeria 1800          6.99
4              Angola 1800          6.93
5 Antigua and Barbuda 1800          5.00
6           Argentina 1800          6.80
```

+ Assign the summarized data to `fertilityMeanByCountry`. 
+ Show `fertilityMeanByCountry`.
+ Next, show average fertility by `Year`, using `group_by/summarize()` assigning the
summarized data to `fertilityMeanByYear`. 
+ Show `fertilityMeanByYear`.

<codeblock id="04_06">
You'll have to first use a `filter()` statement, and then a `group_by/summarize` statement.</codeblock></exercise>

<exercise id="7" title="Putting  dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 all together">

Let's put everything we've learned together on a new data.frame called `MouseBalanceTimeSeries`.

### Instructions

+ Look at the `MouseBalanceTimeSeries` `data.frame`. This is a wide `data.frame` where each column corresponds to the time (in seconds) a mouse stayed on a balance beam pre and post treatment. Here are the first few rows of the dataset:

```
mouseID PreTreat1 PreTreat2 PreTreat3 PostTreat1 PostTreat2 PostTreat3
1      M1       2.1       1.9       1.6        4.4        3.5        5.1
2      M2       1.8       2.6       1.7        5.2        4.9        4.2
3      M3       1.9       1.1       1.8        2.1        2.2        1.8
4      M4       2.4       0.8       2.2        3.1        3.3        3.4
5      M5        NA        NA        NA         NA         NA         NA
6      M6       4.5       4.3       3.8        3.7        4.2        5.6
```
+ `gather()` the measurements into a single column called `time` with a key called `measurementStatus`. 
+ Use `separate()` to make `measurementStatus` into  two columns (`intervention` and `replicate`) by specifying `sep="Treat"`. 
+ Remove any observations that are `NA`. Assign the output to `gatheredMouse`. 
+ Finally, make a boxplot of `gatheredMouse`, plotting `time` versus `intervention` using `geom_boxplot`.

Was there a difference in mean time spent on the balance beam pre and post treatment?

<choice>
<opt text="No, the times were too close to tell.">
Go back and look at the graph.
</opt>
<opt text="Yes, the intervals overlapped, but the means were clearly different" correct="true">
Yes, there is a difference in medians, although the intervals overlapped.</opt>
